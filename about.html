                  I am Eric Sip. A Senior at the
                 <a href="https://www.uri.edu/"> University of Rhode Island </a>. 
                  I am a double major here at URI, studying Biology and Computer Science. Originally, I started URI as a Biology
                  major, it wasn't until this Fall semester of 2023, I added Computer Science. As a kid I always
                  enjoyed playing video games, and I was very in tune with tehcnology and the evolution.
                  Growing up, I've always been an active person, and I also spent a lot of time around family.
                  My favorite sport is basketball, and althought I've never played on a team, I play a lot with
                  friends and family.
